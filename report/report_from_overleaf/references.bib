    edition = {2nd},
    abstract = {The overall structure of this new edition is three-tier: Part I presents the basics, Part II is concerned with methodological issues, and Part III discusses advanced topics. In the second edition the authors have reorganized the material to focus on problems, how to represent them, and then how to choose and design algorithms for different representations. They also added a chapter on problems, reflecting the overall book focus on problem-solvers, a chapter on parameter tuning, which they combined with the parameter control and "how-to" chapters into a methodological part, and finally a chapter on evolutionary robotics with an outlook on possible exciting developments in this field. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses in artificial intelligence and computational intelligence, and for self-study by practitioners and researchers engaged with all aspects of bioinspired design and optimization.}

    abstract = {The main focus of this paper is on the family of evolutionary algorithms and their real-life applications. We present the following algorithms: genetic algorithms, genetic programming, differential evolution, evolution strategies, and evolutionary programming. Each technique is presented in the pseudo-code form, which can be used for its easy implementation in any programming language. We present the main properties of each algorithm described in this paper. We also show many state-of-the-art practical applications and modifications of the early evolutionary methods. The open research issues are indicated for the family of evolutionary algorithms.},

    abstract="The investigation of evolutionary algorithms as adaptation schemes has a long history starting with Holland (1975). The Ising model from physics leads to a variety of different problem instances and it is interesting to investigate how simple evolutionary algorithms cope with these problems. A theoretical analysis is known only for the Ising model on the ring and partially for the Ising model on the two-dimensional torus. Here, the two-dimensional torus, the d-dimensional hypercube, and graphs consisting of two cliques connected by some bridges are investigated experimentally. Many hypotheses are confirmed by rigorous statistical tests.",
